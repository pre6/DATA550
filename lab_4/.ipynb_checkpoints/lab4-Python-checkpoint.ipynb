And the fact that you rely on muscular dexterity for the encoding process as well as passive mechnotransduction for the decoding is truly remarkable (in a primitive sense of course, I guess how your kind can appreciate \"the remarkable complexity\" of a cave painting). Such a system is clearly a bottleneck in terms of information bandwidth and I am surprised a more direct means of intercranial transmission never evolved here, but from the perspective of my research on less evolved galactic lifeforms I find this fascinating!\n",

The implications of this reach beyond just communication as I have recently learned that you also restrict many of your thoughts to those that can be expressed in words (again, fascinating!). This means that you could literally upgrade your thought throughput by learning a new language. And it could mean that there are groups of people who have access to faster thinking others, just because their language can convey information at a higher rate, what an enormous advantage!"
